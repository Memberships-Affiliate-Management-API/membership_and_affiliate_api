 **How it Works?**
 --
    Our API allows developers to create memberships or subscriptions based services and products 
    on their websites or web applications faster, easier and cheaper by intergrating our api in their 
    website, our api will handle 
       - user creation and authentications.
       - products and service creation and management.
       - payment plans creations for services and products on your website. 
       - subscriptions and payment colletiongs through paypal services. 
       - affiliates intergrations for promotional purposes 
       - creation of and management of coupon codes for promotional purposes
