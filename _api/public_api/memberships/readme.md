#### Memberships API 
    The Memberships API simply allows developers to create services on their websites or blogs which can only 
    be accessible when a user becomes a paid or free member (creates subscription) of such a service or product. 
    
    Therefore the Memberships API Allows developers to 
        1. create and describe a service or product
        2. add several subscriptions or payment plans to the service or product
        3. manage clients subscriptions and payment collections for the services and products
    
    The Memberships API is reliant on paypal services for payment collections, so your clients can safely 
    subscribe through paypal to your services and or products.
